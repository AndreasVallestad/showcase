This is a game development project I worked on with a couple of others during my time at Funkweb, made in Unity. It is an arcady coffe shop game, inspired by older flash game titles, 
in which the player takes the role of an overworked employee. I was the main programmer on this project, and all code I have included here was written by me.
At the time of writing the project is still not complete, but is mostly functional. Most of the remaining work is Graphical/UI related, content creation, and maybe some refactoring.
A playtesting build of the game is included.
